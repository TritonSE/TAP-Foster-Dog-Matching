NOW, THEREFORE, incorporating the above recitals and in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants contained herein, and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:

AGREEMENT

1. Term. Foster Care Volunteer shall foster the dog(s) or puppy(ies) (hereinafter, the “Dog”) that TAP places with him/her until such Dog is adopted.

2. Scope of Fostering. Dog shall reside at Foster Care Volunteer’s house, apartment, loft, condominium or other living space (“House”) and such House shall be in good and clean condition. Foster Care Volunteer shall walk, feed, bathe, transport, provide basic training such as housebreaking, play with and provide medical assistance, if necessary, to Dog. In addition, Foster Care Volunteer shall be compassionate and loving to Dog for the entire time that Dog is in his/her care. 

3. Prohibited Practices. Foster Care Volunteer shall not use prong collars on, employ harsh training methods on nor ever strike Dog. In addition, Foster Care Volunteer shall not allow Dog to be without a leash when Dog is outside a securely fenced area. Foster Care Volunteer shall not tie or chain the Dog to a fence or other like item for long periods of time absent a competent adult being present and adequate moving space for Dog. Foster Care Volunteer shall not leave Dog alone in a motor vehicle for an extended period of time when the outside temperature would cause Dog to suffer. 

4. Handbook. Foster Care Volunteer shall abide by the in-depth procedures for fostering as set forth in the Foster Handbook, as amended from time to time, 


5.Inspection of Dog’s Living Condition and Dog. TAP may inspect the living conditions of Dog and Dog for any reason at a time and date mutually agreed upon by TAP and Foster Care Volunteer.

6. Transition Period. Foster Care Volunteer is aware that Dog is a rescue dog and Dog will have to adapt to a change in his/her circumstances (“Transition Period”). As such, Foster Care Volunteer shall be patient and tolerant during such Transition Period, which can extend from a few days to a few months. 

7. Medical Treatment, Expenses and Records. Before Dog is placed with Foster Care Volunteer, TAP shall provide and pay for Dog’s vaccinations and for spaying or neutering of Dog, as the case may be (“Standard Treatment”). Should Dog need nonemergency medical treatment, Foster Care Volunteer shall contact TAP and seek TAP’s approval to cover the cost of treatment before Dog can receive such treatment. Once Foster Care Volunteer receives such approval, he/she shall timely provide Dog with such treatment. If Foster Care Volunteer provides medical treatment to Dog without TAP’s approval, TAP shall not be responsible for paying for or reimbursing Foster Care Volunteer for such expense. In the event Dog requires emergency medical treatment, Foster Care Volunteer shall contact TAP and seek TAP’s approval to cover the cost of such treatment. However, if Foster Care Volunteer determines that Dog needs emergency medical treatment immediately and there is not sufficient time for TAP to be contacted, Foster Care Volunteer shall immediately take Dog to a TAP approved emergency room veterinarian (as designated in the Foster Handbook),  and any costs associated therewith shall be paid for by TAP. Should Foster Care Volunteer take Dog to a non-approved emergency room veterinarian, TAP shall not be responsible for paying for or reimbursing Foster Care Volunteer for such expense. Grooming of Dog will not be paid for by TAP.


8. Notify TAP. Should Foster Care Volunteer have any concerns fostering Dog, Foster Care Volunteer shall contact TAP to discuss such concerns and TAP shall work to eliminate such concerns. Should TAP determine, in its sole discretion, that Dog should no longer be in Foster Care Volunteer’s care, TAP shall attempt to locate another foster care volunteer to foster Dog. If there are any immediate safety issues that arise TAP will remove the dog and address them and find new placement for the dog. 

9. Ownership Rights. Dog is the sole property of TAP and TAP has all of the rights associated therewith. TAP is not transferring ownership of Dog to Foster Care Volunteer by allowing Dog to temporarily reside with Foster Care Volunteer.  TAP shall make all of the decisions with respect to adoption of Dog and Foster Care Volunteer shall return Dog to TAP upon TAP’s request. 

10. Adoption. Foster Care Volunteer shall cooperate with TAP with respect to the adoption of Dog. Foster Care Volunteer agrees that prospective adopters can visit Dog prior to adoption at a time, date and place mutually agreed upon by Foster Care Volunteer and such prospective adopters.

In addition, TAP represents and warrants that Dog has all of its required vaccinations and has been spayed or neutered, as the case may be.
